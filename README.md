Just some r scripts for my own learning.

I am following Udacity's course [Data Analysis with R](https://in.udacity.com/course/data-analysis-with-r--ud651).

Useful R resources:
* [Quick R](https://www.statmethods.net/)
* [R Cookbook](http://www.cookbook-r.com/)
* [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml)
* [Cheat Sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)
* [Data Wrangling in R](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/DataWranglingWithR.pdf)
